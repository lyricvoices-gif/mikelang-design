/* Founder credit line + cycling brand slots, used below the manifesto
   on the home page and under the narrative on /about. The credit
   anchors left with the strip filling the width to its right at
   desktop, stacked at mobile; the strip is a row of fixed slots
   rather than a continuous scroll.

   Each slot swaps its logo with a masked pass through its overflow
   clip: the current mark slides out, the slot sits empty for a beat,
   then the next mark slides into place. Every slot has its own fixed
   exit direction and a deliberately mismatched enter direction (a
   mark leaves sideways, its replacement drops in from above) —
   sampled from the reference choreography, where the varied axes are
   what keep the row feeling alive rather than mechanical. Swaps fire
   round-robin left to right, so a slow wave of change moves across
   the row while the other slots hold still — the strip always reads
   as a settled credit line with exactly one brand in motion.

   Brand order and per-logo optical scales carry over from the
   retired marquee version of this strip. Each incoming mark is
   drawn at random from the off-stage pool and the
   outgoing mark returns to it, so no brand ever appears in two slots
   at once — and slots don't ping-pong between a fixed pair (which is
   what any uniform rotation would do with 8 brands over 4 slots). */

   the reference's six pairs, chosen so both horizontal exits, both
   vertical exits, and all four enter directions each appear once.

   Ordering constraint: the wave handoff overlaps slot i's enter with
   slot i+1's exit (cyclically — slot 4's enter overlaps slot 1's next
   exit), so a slot's enter motion must never equal the next slot's
   exit motion or two marks travel the same direction at once. As
